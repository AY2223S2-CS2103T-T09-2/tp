### Project: Where Got Time

Where Got Time is an addressbook-cum-timetable. Students find it hard to find free time slot within their group of friends in NUS as they have to compare their timetables. 
Therefore, this product helps students to easily find free time slots within a group of NUS friends, and keep track of personal and friends' timetable/schedule.
